# An Overview of the Scientific Method 

Empirical research is based on observations.  However, care must be taken to ensure that everyday observations are not interpreted as general observations as well as deduct general rules from them.  A single observation seldom will provide enough information to deduct and generalize.  The empirical research approach is employed to avoid poor interpretations and misleading results that stem from non-systemic observations.  The key is to plan: Why are observations needed?  What should be observed?  How should be observed?  When should be observed?

The initial question must be why to observe a specific phenomenon.  This establishes the need for the overall study as well as sets the guidelines in terms of methodology Typically this is flanked by a research hypothesis, where specific expected results are laid out, next to why the expected results will happen.  The question of whom or what to observe determines whether an entire population or just a sample of that population will be observed.  When obtaining a sample, typically it is required to protect against bias by ensuring not to select individuals or subgroups that do not adequately represent the entire population. 

The actual observation approach (how) determines what measures will be used.  Sometimes this will result in new measures that need to be developed.  When an observation takes place can have a significant impact on the results and needs to be planned together concerning the overall research questions and hypothesis. 

The result of these observations is data that will subsequently be analyzed statistically.  Not always are numerical data points directly available; in those cases, we refer to qualitative rather than quantitative research. (In this course, we will focus on quantitative research.) An additional distinction is whether the research is experimental or nonexperimental.  In experimental research, there are typically cause and effect questions that need to be answered.  The result is a configuration where treatments are being performed on a specific group to determine a specific outcome based on the treatment.  An alternative is nonexperimental research, which does not involve a specific treatment.

As the steps involved in scientific inquiry are commonly the same, they have been systematically combined into the *Scientific Method*. This methodic approach provides an excellent framework for systematic approaches to research. 

## Experiments

Experiments are characterized by a specific treatment. The treatment is applied to the experimental group, whereas no treatment is applied to the control group. When the selection into each of the two groups is random, the experiment is considered to be a true experiment. If groups are the result of volunteering or self-selection, it is not a true experiment. An alternative are non-experimental approaches such as surveys or polls. Some of the measurements employed are the same in each of the two approaches (paper-and-pencil tests, etc.), so it is not immediately obvious which of the two approaches are part of a specific study. Sometimes, it is not practically possible to conduct an experiment, such as for very long time scales. In that case, groups with similar demographics (or, generally characteristics) can be selected and observations about the groups can be used to perform, e.g., a causal-comparative study to determine cause and effect based on past and current observations without experimentation. Other examples of nonexperimental research are surveys/polls, case studies, longitudinal research, as well as historical or correlational research. All of these types of research are here considered as quantitative research.

Conducting experiments typically requires the modification of inputs.  Even in nonexperimental studies, a *variable* is employed to group incoming data samples.  Each variable here must have mutually exclusive categories (e.g., for gender the categories could be male/female/non-binary/unknown). Furthermore, one variable could be the input (independent) variable, and another be the observed output (dependent) variable.  Experiments always have at least one independent and one dependent variable. Experiments determine the change that the independent variable causes in the dependent variable. Oftentimes, there could be more than one independent variable part of experiments, in which case multiple groups need to be created that represent the different combinations of the independent variables. 

Variables are typically conceptually defined in a first high-level step. This will allow a general view on what will be evaluated. However, if experiments are to determine more detail, a variable needs to be operationally defined, which includes a higher level of detail. For example, a variable to determine the reliability of a new car model in the first month after purchase, the number of repairs for that model can be used. However, it is impossible to determine all impact factors to the variable (weather conditions throughout the month, which humans/robots assembled it, where did the minerals for the steel come from, and so on). The focus here should be on enabling replicability of the experiments, which is a tenet of scientific research.

## Hypotheses and Theories

The hypothesis is a prediction of the future outcome of the study to be conducted. The hypothesis might be “an educated guess” or grounded in theory. As before, a hypothesis is common for all types of research (experimental as well as nonexperimental). A directional hypothesis already predicts a certain correlation (though not fine-grained in detail) between groups, whereas as nondirectional hypothesis basically states that there will be a difference between groups. It might be better formulated as a stated research purpose or a research question. Note that you should avoid simply turning these into “investigate the difference between A and B after treatment” but also include “investigate how A and B differ after treatment”.

 A theory is a unified and oftentimes generalized attempt at explaining observations. As Wikipedia puts it:

*In modern* [*science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science)*, the term "theory" refers to* [*scientific theories*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory)*, a well-confirmed type of explanation of* [*nature*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature)*, made in a way* [*consistent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency) *with* [*scientific method*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)*, and fulfilling the* [*criteria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory#Characteristics_of_theories) *required by* [*modern science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_science)*. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide* [*empirical*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence) *support for it, or empirical contradiction ("*[*falsify*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)*") of it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,*[*[1\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory#cite_note-1) *in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word* [*hypothesis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis)*).*[*[2\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory#cite_note-2) *Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically* [*testable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testable) [*conjectures*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture)*, and from* [*scientific laws*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_laws)*, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions.*

Theories serve as starting points to deduce hypotheses from, in line or extending the theory. Alternatively, theories can be induced from observations and conclusions made therefrom.  In qualitative research, the grounded theory is based on observations. 

## Ethical considerations

Notice that we do not explicitly consider research involving human subjects here. However, there are significant impacts that research has on human subjects, and they need to be protected from physical and psychological harm. As science has performed abhorred experimentation in the past, a set of norms and regulations has been put into place to prevent this from happening again. A specific norm is that of informed consent, i.e., human subjects need to be aware that they are part of a study and what it entails (in a nutshell). However, there are significant more norms to uphold, as well as exceptions. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are part of universities that evaluate the research protocols and ensure that they adhere to the established rules. They also ensure that researchers undergo special training that covers working with human subjects.

For example, at CMU the IRB is part of the broader Office of Research Compliance at https://www.cmich.edu/office_provost/ORGS/ComplianceandResearchIntegrity/InstitutionalReviewBoard/Pages/default.aspx

 ## Literature Review

 A great way to get new ideas, refresh old ideas, and to make sure you do not duplicate existing work. (Note: duplicating existing work to prove and validate are excluded in this notion; generally, all research should be replicable.)

Another benefit for conducting a literature research is the overall familiarization with a potentially new domain in one’s research field, getting to know research measures and their applicability, as well as other hints that will help to successfully conduct and publish research.

When conducting the literature research, one has to consider a broad range of potential sources. A good first stop is the local library (library.cmich.edu) as well as other, professional membership sites. Google scholar has become increasingly popular for quick first searches, but one must carefully consider the results. For example, several professional organizations (such as the ACM or IEEE for computing domains) are no longer only publishing their own, carefully peer-reviewed, and typically higher quality research results, but also provide a paid publishing service (technically co-sponsored), which should be more scrutinized when selecting literature. 

The literature review should be critical, for example scrutinize existing or employed methods and measurements, as well as derive the need for new work therefrom. Once several pieces of literature are combined, they should be concluded with a synthesis that leads to the needs of one’s own work. Throughout a research report, you will typically use different citation approaches that depend on the field and the publication outlet, with several different styles in use today (MLA, APA, IEEE, …). We are not covering all of these in detail here but be aware that they typically all adhere to strict formatting rules. 

(Note: also, reviewers can look at the references/bibliography section of your work – sloppiness here can be seen as an indicator for sloppiness in the rest of your work!)
